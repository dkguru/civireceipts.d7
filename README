This module requires CiviCRM 4 and Drupal 7

To use:

1. Put the files on sites/all/modules so that you have a folder called 
   sites/all/modules/civireceipts

2. Enable the module

3. Visit admin/config/civireceipts to set your settings

4. Visit civicrm/civireceipts to search and generate receipts. They will not 
   look great on screen because the page break only works when you print. 
   Use Print Preview. :)

5. The template file .tpl.php and the CSS file .css are what you can easily 
   edit, if you has knowledge of HTML and CSS. The template file has PHP 
   also but it's all encapsulated in blocks and so it should be easy to 
   edit the rest of it.
